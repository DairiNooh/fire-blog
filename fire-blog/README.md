# FireBlog

## Blog Description & Background

FireBlog is a full-stack blog application focused on emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Robotics, and next-generation software trends. The platform supports full CRUD operations for blog posts, comments, and likes, allowing users to interact with content in a dynamic way.

I created this project to strengthen my backend and database skills using Node.js and MongoDB, while building a real-world blog application that shares knowledge about modern and future technologies.
